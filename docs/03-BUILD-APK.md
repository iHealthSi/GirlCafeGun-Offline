# 03 — Rebuild the offline APK

> **Current build (2026-11-11):** `python apk-build/build_offline_apk.py` compiles `shim.c`, `host.c` and
> the installer and repacks `gcg_offline_fixed.apk` into `GirlCafeGun.apk`; `python apk-build/make_data_package.py`
> builds `GirlCafeGun-data.gcg`. `host.c` now turns off heap pointer tagging (required on real phones) and
> keeps saves in `files/sssjsave`. When the server changes, re-run `dotnet publish` (steps below) and replace
> the data tar **and** the 7 runtime `.so` together. See [05-PHONE-PORT.md](05-PHONE-PORT.md).

How the self-contained APK is made, in case you change the server and want to re-bake it.
The build sources are in `apk-build/`. The emulator route (`INSTALL.bat`, `scripts/install.ps1`) uses `gcg_offline.apk`. The phone package route (`tools/package.ps1`, `HOW-TO-INSTALL.txt`) uses `GirlCafeGun.apk`, built from the base APK `gcg_offline_fixed.apk`.

## One command: `tools/package.ps1` (use this)
```powershell
powershell -File tools\package.ps1 -Password <pw> # normal run (or set env GCG_PACK_PASSWORD)
powershell -File tools\package.ps1 -RebuildData    # force a new GirlCafeGun-data.gcg
powershell -File tools\package.ps1 -SplitSize 3900m  # split the full pack into 7-Zip volumes
```
What it does, in order: `dotnet publish` (linux-bionic-arm64, PublishAot=false) -> `apk-build/build_offline_apk.py --publish`
(re-bakes `libsssjdata.so` and the 7 runtime `.so` from the fresh publish, rebuilds shim/host/installer, zipaligns,
signs with `sssj.keystore`) -> verify (apksigner; embedded server DLL SHA-256 == fresh publish) -> data pack
(`make_data_package.py`; reused when no input is newer) -> two archives in `dist/` -> content allowlist check.

- Base APK: `gcg_offline_fixed.apk` in the project root (stock game + libil2cpp patch + shim). It is git-ignored; keep it.
- Packs (archive name carries `<date>-<commit>`, `-dirty` if tracked inputs are uncommitted):
  - `GirlCafeGun-<ver>-update.zip` = `GirlCafeGun.apk`, `INSTALL.txt`, `VERSION.txt`, `CHECKSUMS.sha256`. Small. For people who already ran the data install.
  - `GirlCafeGun-<ver>-full.zip` = the same + `GirlCafeGun-data.gcg`. First install. The data pack is stored, not compressed (bundles are already compressed).
  - Nothing else goes in: no server source, keystore, tools or logs. The script fails if an unexpected file is in a pack.
- The work runs detached in its own window (`Win32_Process.Create`); the calling command waits for `dist/logs/package-<stamp>.done`.
  Log: `dist/logs/package-<stamp>.log`. Summary: `dist/last-result.txt`. Checksums of the packs: `dist/SHA256SUMS.txt`.
- After every change: commit, run the script, put `dist/last-result.txt` (paths, sizes, commit) into the card comment, move the card to `review`.
- Install on a phone: `adb install -r dist\...apk` keeps saves and data (same signature). Ask the project owner first.

The manual steps below explain what the script automates.

`-Password` (or the `GCG_PACK_PASSWORD` environment variable) is required: it is the AES-256 password of both zip packs. The script stops without it.

## How it works
A shim replaces the game's tiny `libmain.so` (Unity's JNI entry) and, on launch:
1. **chains** the original libmain so the game boots normally,
2. **extracts** the bundled server to the app's data dir, **symlinks the runtime `.so` out of the app's
   native-library dir** (the exec-allowed folder — this is what makes it work without root), and
   **forks it as a separate process** (the .NET runtime cannot share the app's process with Unity's
   il2cpp — it aborts), hosting it via `hostfxr`,
3. **patches il2cpp in memory** (read via `/proc/self/mem`, which can't SIGSEGV) so the client uses
   `http://127.0.0.1:9080` with the offline-account path; the patch runs in a **continuous re-apply
   loop** (~5 min) so `disablegm=0` + `platform=selftest` survive the client's own `PackageInfo.Load`
   overwrite right up until it builds the serverlist URL, even on a slow cold boot,
4. the client then talks to the embedded server on `127.0.0.1:9080` (http bootstrap) / `9600` (gate).

Everything (the .NET runtime, the server DLLs, and the `setting/` tables) is packed into one file,
`lib/arm64-v8a/libsssjdata.so` (a gzip tar), plus the shim, the host, and the runtime `.so` — which
ship as their own `lib/arm64-v8a/*.so` entries so Android installs them into the exec-allowed native
library dir.

## Build sources (`apk-build/`)
- `shim.c` → compiled to `libmain.so` (the shim: fork the host, patch il2cpp, chain libmain).
- `host.c` → compiled to `libsssjhost.so` (hosts the server via hostfxr in its own process).
- `repack.py` → zip surgery: from a pristine stock APK (`orig.apk`), drop the old `libmain.so` + the
  old signature, add the new `lib/arm64-v8a/*` entries.
- `sssj.keystore` → the signing key (store/key password `sssjsssj`, alias `sssj`).
- `libmain_orig_arm64.so` → the stock Unity libmain (shipped inside the APK as `libmain_orig.so`).

Historical: the manual steps below describe the first emulator build. The current build is `tools\package.ps1` (above).

## Tools needed
- **.NET 10 SDK** (to publish the server for Android).
- **Android NDK r27** (clang) and **build-tools** (`zipalign`, `apksigner`) — from Android Studio /
  the Android SDK.
- **Python 3** (for `repack.py`).
- A copy of the **stock** `com.biligameglobal.girlcafegungp.apk` named `orig.apk` next to `repack.py`.

## Steps (from `apk-build/`)

# 1b. the 7 runtime .so ALSO ship as their own lib-dir entries (Android installs them to the
#     exec-allowed native-library dir; the shim symlinks them next to the DLLs at runtime).

# 1c. (optional, for full airplane-mode play) patch the client's reachability gate. Copy the stock
#     arm64-v8a libil2cpp.so out of orig.apk and force Game.Utils.IsNetworkOk + Login.IsNetworkReachability
#     to return true, so "New Account" works with NO network. (See "Airplane mode" below for why we patch
#     only these two, not the global getter.) Shipping it as a lib-dir entry makes repack.py replace the
#     stock one.

```

Re-signing with the same key means you can update an already-installed copy with `adb install -r`
(no uninstall, keeps the OBB and save data).

## Gotchas (learned the hard way)
- The `.a` files (`libmono-component-*.a`, `libmonosgen-2.0.a`) **must** be in the data tar or the
  runtime aborts with *"corlib not met"*.
- Do **not** use the stock apphost's self-location — under the emulator's arm translation
  (`/proc/self/exe` resolves to a translation path); host via `hostfxr` with explicit paths instead.
- Read il2cpp memory with `/proc/self/mem` (`O_RDONLY` + `pread`), never a raw dereference — a direct
  read near the end of the 84 MB lib SIGSEGVs under translation, and `process_vm_readv` on self is
  flaky under the emulator's arm translation (returns garbage). `/proc/self/mem` is the kernel's own
  view and is reliable. Writes target the managed heap, so a guarded `memcpy` is fine.
- Patch in a **re-apply loop**, not once. The client's `PackageInfo.Load` rewrites `platform` back to
  its online value after a one-shot patch; re-writing `disablegm=0` + `platform=selftest` every ~30 ms
  for ~5 min (re-resolving `PackageInfo.Instance` each pass) makes the values stick until the client has
  built the serverlist URL — the long window covers a pathologically slow cold boot where `Instance`
  initializes tens of seconds in.
- Set `disablegm=0` **early** (the loop does, within ~1 s of il2cpp mapping). With it clear before the
  URL is built, the client never upgrades `http://127.0.0.1:9080` to `https`, so no socket surgery is
  needed — don't kill the `:9080` socket (it drops the good http connection).

## Non-rooted phones — no network needed
The server runs out of the app's **native-library** dir, not the data dir, so it does **not** need
root: Android marks the lib dir exec-allowed, and the shim symlinks the runtime `.so` there before
forking the host. (The data dir, which stock arm64 / targetSdk 30+ blocks from executing under
SELinux, only holds the DLLs + `setting/` — no exec.) This was proven end-to-end on an arm64 emulator:
fresh account, encrypted gate session, tutorial.

### Airplane mode (the libil2cpp patch, step 1c)
The client's **New Account** handler calls `Game.Utils.IsNetworkOk()` — which returns
`Application.internetReachability != NotReachable` — and shows *"Connection error. Please check your
network."* when it's false, **before** it ever touches the local server. All game traffic is localhost,
so the check is pointless offline. Step 1c patches `IsNetworkOk` (RVA `0x14F48DC`) and the login-screen
variant `Game.Login.IsNetworkReachability` (RVA `0x1BEBDA4`) to `mov w0,#1; ret` (always true). With
that, a fresh account logs in and plays the tutorial with the device in **full airplane mode** — proven
end-to-end.

Patch *only* those two helpers — **not** the underlying `UnityEngine.Application::get_internetReachability`
(RVA `0x3064888`). The boot sequence also consults reachability; forcing the global getter "online"
makes a boot-time sync retry forever offline (the app pegs a core on the splash and never reaches the
title). The two high-level helpers are reached only from the login/New-Account path, so patching them
leaves boot seeing the real (offline) state while letting New Account through.

Timing matters too: the shim's in-memory config patch (`disablegm=0` → local http) must land before the
client's first reachability-gated sync, or that sync hits the online URL, fails offline, and spins. The
shim's patch loop runs up to ~5 min and re-resolves `PackageInfo.Instance` every 30 ms, so it lands even
on a slow cold boot.

Asset delivery (the ~1.7 GB OBB + the extra bundles) is the other non-root consideration: the OBB goes
to the public `Android/obb/<pkg>/` (writable over `adb push` without root), and the bundles go to the
app's external files dir. `sync_device_assets.ps1` uses `su` for a rooted emulator. A plain `adb push` into
`Android/data` does not work without root (see [04-NO-ROOT.md](04-NO-ROOT.md)). On a phone, use the first-run
installer in the APK or `assets\sync_phone.ps1`: see [05-PHONE-PORT.md](05-PHONE-PORT.md) and
[../HOW-TO-INSTALL.txt](../HOW-TO-INSTALL.txt).
