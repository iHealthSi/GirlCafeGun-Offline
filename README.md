# Girl Cafe Gun — Offline (EN v1.0.9)

An **unofficial, offline, single-player** build of Girl Cafe Gun. The game server is
**embedded inside the APK** — install it and play with **no account, no internet, and no PC**.
Everything stays on the device; it works in full **airplane mode**.

> **This repository ships no game assets.** The game, its art/audio/text, and the client
> belong to **Seasun (西山居)** and its publishers. You provide the game files yourself (from a
> copy of the official app you own), delivered as a separate **asset pack** you host. See
> **[CREDITS.md](CREDITS.md)** for full attribution and IP notice, and
> **[docs/project.html](docs/project.html)** for an overview + the limitations table.

For preservation and study only. **Scan anything you download before running it.**

> **Update 2026-11-12: real phones, English, gamepad, no PC.** The build now runs on non-rooted
> arm64 phones (tested: Galaxy S24+, Android 17). A first-run installer inside the APK loads the game
> data from one file, so a player needs no PC, no adb and no root: see
> [HOW-TO-INSTALL.txt](HOW-TO-INSTALL.txt). Server and GM text is in English. Also new: free store
> packs offline, working GM money buttons, all-or-nothing gacha, event achievements, a Bluetooth
> gamepad layer and local copies of the web pages the client used to load online. The list is in
> [docs/05-PHONE-PORT.md](docs/05-PHONE-PORT.md).

> **Update 2026-11-14: the project base is now GirlCafeGun-Remake.** New feature work goes to
> [zirenmidori/GirlCafeGun-Remake](https://github.com/zirenmidori/GirlCafeGun-Remake) (TypeScript server, chapters 1-16,
> signed updates). This repository stays as the C# build and as the source of fixes that are ported there
> (pull requests 1 to 4 on that repository: save backups, controller, story editor, title screens).

## Quick start — just play

1. **Get the asset pack** (the ~6 GB of game files needed to play) and unzip it so that
   `gcg_offline.apk` and the `assets/` folder sit next to **`INSTALL.bat`**. (The emulator route
   (`INSTALL.bat`, `scripts/install.ps1`) uses `gcg_offline.apk`. The phone package route (`tools/package.ps1`,
   `HOW-TO-INSTALL.txt`) uses `GirlCafeGun.apk`, built from the base APK `gcg_offline_fixed.apk`.)
2. Start an **arm64** Android emulator — [MuMu Player 12](https://www.mumuplayer.com/) with
   **Root** on is easiest — or connect an arm64 phone with USB debugging.
3. Double-click **`INSTALL.bat`**.

It installs the APK, puts the OBB in place, syncs the content bundles, and launches the game.
First launch shows a Terms screen → **Agree to all & start**; at the title (server shows
**Local**) tap **New Account** and play. No internet needed.

Full step-by-step: **[docs/01-PLAY.md](docs/01-PLAY.md)**.

### Using a hosted download link

The asset pack is too large (and too copyrighted) to live in this repo, so **you host it** and
point the installer at it:

```powershell
# one time: build the pack, then upload dist\gcg_assets.* to your host (Drive / MEGA / torrent)
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\make-asset-pack.ps1

# players then run:
INSTALL.bat -AssetPackUrl https://your-host/gcg_assets.zip
```

The installer downloads the pack, extracts it, and installs — so a single link is all a player
needs from you.

What's intentionally **not** here (it's game-owned, delivered in the asset pack): the OBB, the
asset `Bundles/`, Live2D models, the built `gcg_offline.apk`, `server/setting/`, and any Seasun
client binaries. The build scripts read those from *your* stock APK / pack at build time.

---

## How it works (short version)

A shim replaces the game's tiny `libmain.so` and, on launch, starts the bundled .NET server as a
local process, points the client at `http://127.0.0.1:9080`, and patches the client's
offline/airplane gates in memory. The whole server — runtime + the open-source `sssj-new` server +
the config tables — ships inside the APK. **No root needed**: the runtime runs from the app's
native-library dir, not the SELinux-blocked data dir. Details: **[docs/project.html](docs/project.html)**
and **[docs/03-BUILD-APK.md](docs/03-BUILD-APK.md)**.

## Build it yourself

```powershell
# server only (native Android arm64 build):
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\build-server.ps1

# full offline APK (needs your own stock base.apk, the .NET 10 SDK, Android NDK r27 + build-tools):
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\build-apk.ps1 -OrigApk C:\path\to\base.apk
```

Re-signing uses the included debug key, so you can update an install in place with `adb install -r`.

## Limitations (read before expecting everything to work)

| Area | Status |
|------|--------|
| Offline play / airplane mode | ✅ Works (fresh account, tutorial, story, gacha, shop) |
| "Connection error" / calls official server | ✅ Fixed — serverlist points local statically ([docs/10-CONNECTION-FIX.md](docs/10-CONNECTION-FIX.md)) + airplane gate patched |
| Missing voice / scenes / art | ✅ Fixed — the full bundle set the game references now ships |
| Censored Live2D touch/flirting interactions | ✅ Restored by default (love.u) — [docs/09-UNCENSOR.md](docs/09-UNCENSOR.md); `-NoUncensor` to opt out |
| Chinese title buttons (新账号 / 输入账号) | ✅ Fixed — the login prefab carries English labels ([docs/05-PHONE-PORT.md](docs/05-PHONE-PORT.md)) |
| Background telemetry calls | ⚠️ Harmless — fail silently offline; don't block play |
| Non-rooted phones | ✅ Works — in-game data installer ([HOW-TO-INSTALL.txt](HOW-TO-INSTALL.txt)) or `assets\sync_phone.ps1` over adb; Shizuku / file manager route in [docs/04-NO-ROOT.md](docs/04-NO-ROOT.md) |
| Real arm64 phones (Android 11+) | ✅ Fixed — heap pointer tagging is turned off before the server runtime starts |
| Store packs / paid currency offline | ✅ Granted free; GM panel money buttons work |
| Bluetooth gamepad in shooting stages | ✅ Works — [docs/11-CONTROLLER.md](docs/11-CONTROLLER.md) |
| Notice / server-error web pages | ✅ Served by the embedded server — [docs/08-ONLINE-RESOURCES.md](docs/08-ONLINE-RESOURCES.md) |
| Official online services / multiplayer | ❌ Out of scope by design |
